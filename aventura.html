<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Melting Snowman Game</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
You can see that for this configuration, the HTML file is linked to a "style.css" stylesheet that we'll deal with in a bit.

After setting up the <head> section, you'll create a <body> section that will contain the content of the webpage. There can be many sections here, such as an instructions paragraph that teaches users how to play the game. This is a simple addition, and can be churned out easily with AI. Although, since we will be hosting this on your website, be sure to check it for AI content against possible penalizations.

Inside the <body> section, create a <div> with a class attribute of "container". This will be the main container for the game.

Within the container, create an <h1> element with the text "Melting Snowman Game" as the title of the game. Below the title, create another <div> with a class attribute of "Melting Snowman". This will be where the visual representation of the Melting Snowman will be generated dynamically using JavaScript.

Next, create a <div> with a class attribute of "word". This will be where the current word to be guessed is displayed, and it will also be dynamically generated using JavaScript. Create another <div> with a class attribute of "letters" where the letters that have been guessed will be displayed. This, too, will be generated dynamically using JavaScript.

Finally, create one more <div> with a class attribute of "message". This is where the win/lose message will be displayed at the end of the game. With these HTML elements in place, you can now move on to styling the game with CSS and implementing its functionality with JavaScript. Here's what that all looks like:

<div class="container">
    <h1>Melting Snowman Game</h1>
    <div class="Melting Snowman">
      <!-- The Melting Snowman graphic will be dynamically generated using JavaScript -->
    </div>
    <div class="word">
      <!-- The current word will be dynamically generated using JavaScript -->
    </div>
    <div class="letters">
      <!-- The letters will be dynamically generated using JavaScript -->
    </div>
    <div class="message">
      <!-- The win/lose message will be dynamically generated using JavaScript -->
    </div>
  </div>
Similar to the stylesheet, the "MeltingSnowman.js" file will be linked to the JavaScript file to handle the game's functionality in the future.

If you have been following along with these guidelines, the rudimentary HTML structure for the Melting Snowman game is good to go. Following this, we can incorporate some CSS styling to enhance the game's visual appeal.

To sum up, here is the final complete HTML file snippet that we've created until this point:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Melting Snowman Game</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <h1>Melting Snowman Game</h1>
    <div class="Melting Snowman">
      <!-- The Melting Snowman graphic will be dynamically generated using JavaScript -->
    </div>
    <div class="word">
      <!-- The current word will be dynamically generated using JavaScript -->
    </div>
    <div class="letters">
      <!-- The letters will be dynamically generated using JavaScript -->
    </div>
    <div class="message">
      <!-- The win/lose message will be dynamically generated using JavaScript -->
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <script src="MeltingSnowman.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
